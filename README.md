# Reddit scraping tool

## What is this?

A tool that traverses a .csv document with all registered cars in the UK and then uses each of the car names to perform a search on Reddit. This was a supporting piece of code for my thesis project where the information obtained through this code will be and collated for later Sentiment Analysis and inclusion in a machine learning model. 

## Things this tool Can Do:

- Traverse a csv file to find all car brand/models registered in the UK
- Utilising the Reddit API, perform a search for each one of the names found.
- Collect and prepare a new set of data for later sentiment analysis.
